My name is William Chan, I am currently a student at Microsoft Software & Systems Academy. 
My personal objective for my project is to showcase my proficiency in cloud application development, which will increase my chance of being hired as a software developer by potential employers.   

My first reviewed project is a bug tracker. The purpose of this software application is to keep track of bugs or issues in software development project.
The application will have a log-in page to reinforce security with authentication. Upon being logged in to the application, a process of authorization will begin and grant privileges based on user's roles. 
The application will also have a data-base that can to be created, read, updated and deleted by authorized user. A friendly user interface will be implemented to ensure the application can be easily navigated and operated by general publics.    
 

My second reviewed project is a web-based financial portal. The purpose of this application is to allow users to conduct banking function such as transfer funds between accounts, pay credit card debt and query their account balance.
The application will have a log-in page to reinforce its security with authentication system. It will also have a data-base that contain all user's log-in information and their account information. The data-base will be updated promptly when certain function is performed.
It will also allow users to upload files so they can deposit checks through the application. 

My third reviewed project is a web-page for a swim club. The purpose of this application is to provide a platform for the members of the club to track event dates, upload event photos and sign up for swim meets.
The application will have a log-in page, which utilize third-party authentication system to provide security. 
It will have a data-base that store members basic information, events information, and photos uploaded by authorized members. It will also have a built in calendar that will display upcoming events, and the members will be able to sign themselves up by interacting with the calendar.     


I will utilize software requirements specification(SRS) to figure out what features should I include in my application. Once I have all features listed, I will schedule multiple weekly sprints to accomplish each feature and track my progress along the way.
By utilizing SRS and weekly sprints to accomplish my project, I will demonstrate my ability to plan, execute and accomplish a software development project in a professional manner. 
Not only will this showcase my proficiency in software development, but as well as my proficiency in project management. Which will undoubtedly increase my chance of being hired as a software developer.
