# ISTAProject
* This is the repository for my project. I applied what I have learned from the MSSA Cohort for past three months and built a bug tracker web application. The purpose of this application is to help me keep track the bugs and desired features of all of the softwares I intent to develope. I am using ASP.NET Core, SQL server, C# and MVC for the development of this application.
