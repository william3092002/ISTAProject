# ISTAProject
* This is the repository for my project. I applied learned knowledge from the MSSA Cohort to build a bug tracker web application. The purpose of this application is to help me keep track of all the bugs and desired features of the softwares I am currently developing. I am using ASP.NET Core, SQL server, C# and MVC for the development of this application.
