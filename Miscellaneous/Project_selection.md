My name is William Chan. I'm a student of Microsoft Software and Systems Academy. 
I choose to make a cloud base project management application. 
My objective for this project is to apply knowledge I learend on developing a cloud-based application, which will showcase my ability to quickly learn a concenpt and apply it practically. 

My database will contain following information: 
1. A table named project that includes schema such as 
	- project ID 
	- project name 
	- who is this project assign to 
	- what's the priority of this project
	- due date 
	- estimation 
	- project description
2. A table named user that includes schema such as
	- user ID
	- user name
	- user role, which will be either memeber or admin
	- user e-mail
3. A table named task that includes schema such as
	- project ID
	- task ID
	- task name
	- task priority
	- task due date
	- task assigned to 
	- task assigned by
	- task estimated completion date
	
My project will be consist of three main conponents in order to showcase my ability to quickly learn a concenpt and apply it practically. 

1. The front end. This is the interface between users and database. My main goal for this component is to provide users features that will assit them in tracking and visualizing the progress of their project.
2. The back end. This is where I will handle various behind the scene tasks that support the front end interface. Tasks that will require me to apply C# and TSQL to accomplish. Tasks such as: 
	- user authentication
	- order handling from users
	- role assigment
	- data validation
	- data storage
	- database access
3. The last component of my project is to setup a server on cloud to provide the service my application will offer. I will be utilizing Microsoft Azure to host and deploy my application. 

The users can expect below features from the itnerface.
	- a user log-in page that provides front end authentication
	- a project interface where members can review and comment on projects they're assigned to. 
	Some of the features they can expect from this interface are:
		- they can view the progress of the projects
		- they can view the members assigned to the same projects
		- member's e-mail address or contact information 
		- tasks within the projects
	- a task interface where members can review and comment on tasks they're assigned to.
	features they can expect from this interface are:
		- they can view detail information of the tasks assigned to them
		- they can estimated completion time of the task assigned to them, modify it as necessary
		- a section to input comments for various reasons
		- visualized progress of their tasks
		
I will approach this project with three general steps:
1. Software requirement specification. This is where I research different project management applications, review the product and their user reviews to help me understand what's useful and what's not. 
2. Plan my sprints. This is where I break apart the projects by features, plan my schedule and track my progress with a project management application of my desire. 
3. Execution. This is the step where I develop the features of my projects with multiple 2 week sprints and a dead line.
